# ⭐ Part 2: Selected Feature

## ✅ Selected Feature: Zoom

### Why Zoom is the Best Feature

The Zoom feature allows detailed visual inspection of UI elements at different levels (50%, 100%, 200%).  
It helps in:

- Checking pixel-perfect alignment  
- Verifying spacing and layout consistency  
- Inspecting UI clarity  
- Reviewing large designs efficiently  

Zoom plays an important role in visual quality assurance and design validation.

# 🧪 Part 3: Test Case Creation

Test cases were written in TestRail for the Zoom feature.

## ✔ Included:
- Clear test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results (recorded during execution)
- Edge cases

## 🔎 Edge Cases Covered:
- Very large file
- Multiple users editing simultaneously
- Slow network
- No network

Total Test Cases: 10+

# 🖥 Part 4: Test Execution (TestRail)

## Steps Performed:
1. Created a Test Run in TestRail
2. Executed each test case
3. Marked result (Passed / Failed / Blocked)
4. Attached screenshots as evidence
5. Recorded actual results

All executions were properly documented.
